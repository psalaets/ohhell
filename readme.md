# Rules

Starting at one, one more card is dealt on each round than the previous round.  After the eight round, cards dealt per round decreases by one.

Card dealt per round:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Each player bids on how many tricks they will take

## Trick Taking

- Whoever went first plays a card which sets the suit
- Remaining players must play a card of that suit if they have one.  They can play anything if they can't follow suit.
- Whoever has the best card takes the trick

### Card Ranking

1. Spades, higher is better
2. Cards that follow suit, higher is better
3. Cards that don't follow suit

## Scoring

- Players that meet their bid exactly get (bid + 10) points
- Player that miss their bid lose (bid + 10) points

## End of Game

Whoever has the most points after all rounds have been played is the winner

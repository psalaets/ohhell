# Rules

## Decks

Use one or two decks.  If using two decks designate one as "better" for breaking ties.

## Dealing

The player on the dealer's left is the next round's dealer.

Starting at one, deal one more card on each round than the previous round.  After the eight round, cards dealt per round decreases by one.

Card dealt per round:
1, 2, 3, ... 7, 8, 7, ... 3, 2, 1

## Round Play

1. Starting with the dealer and going to dealer's left, players bid on how many tricks they will take
2. The dealer plays the first card (winner of each trick plays the first card on the next trick)
3. Remaining players must play a card of that suit if they have one.  They can play anything if they can't follow suit.

## Trick Taking

Player with highest ranking card takes the trick

### Card Ranking

1. Spades, higher is better
2. Cards that follow suit, higher is better
3. Cards that don't follow suit

## Scoring

- Players that meet their bid exactly get (bid + 10) points
- Player that miss their bid lose (bid + 10) points

## End of Game

Player with most points after all rounds have been played is the winner
